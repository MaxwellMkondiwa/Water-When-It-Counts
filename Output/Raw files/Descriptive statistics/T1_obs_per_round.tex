\multicolumn{8}{@{}p{1.25\textwidth}}{\footnotesize Notes: Two of the three schemes were included in round one, with the third added for round 2, causing the substantial increase in households and plots from round 1 to 2. During each round, households that weren't surveyed in any previous round are also asked about missed rounds retroactively, so reponse rates are expected to be higher for earlier rounds, as there were multiple occasions for households to be asked about their respective periods.}
